        <p class="hilma">First abstract painter</p>
        <div class="details">
        Hilma Af Klint was a Swedish artist and mystic. She may have been the first abstract painter in history but since her work wasn't 
        discovered until 1985, 40 years after her death, Wassily Kandinsky has been presented as the first abstract painter.
        Hilma's curiosity about the spiritual realm soon developed into a lifelong interest in spiritism, theosophy and anthroposophy, and during one seance she heard a spirit tell her to "make paintings that would represent the immortal aspects of man. This proved to be the turning point in her work: from the naturalistic to the abstract, from portrayals of physical reality to conveying the invisible."

         Sappho was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos.
         She lived between 630-570 BC. Sappho is known for her lyric poetry, written to be sung and accompanied by a lyre.
         Sappho was a prolific poet, probably composing around 10,000 lines. Her poetry was well-known and greatly admired through much of antiquity, and she was among the canon of nine lyric poets most highly esteemed by scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria. Today, most of Sappho's poetry is lost, but it is still considered extraordinary, and her works have continued to influence other writers up until the modern day.

           <div class="fridadetails">
            Frida Kahlo was a Mexican painter, who mostly painted self-portraits.
            Inspired by Mexican popular culture, she employed a naive folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society. Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy.
            In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary Mexicanidad movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist. Her work has been celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican national and indigenous traditions, and by feminists for what is seen as its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form.

              Alice Guy-Blache, born in 1873, was the first person to be a film director and writer of narrative fiction films.
              She experimented with Gaumont's Chronophone sound syncing system, color tinting, interracial casting, and special effects.

                Vivian Dorothy Maier (born 1926) was an American street photographer. Maier worked for about forty years as a nanny, mostly in Chicago's North Shore, pursuing photography during her spare time. She took more than 150,000 photographs during her lifetime, primarily of the people and architecture of New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles, although she also traveled and photographed worldwide.
                During her lifetime, Maier's photographs were unknown and unpublished; many of her negatives were never printed. A Chicago collector, John Maloof, acquired some of Maier's photos in 2007
                and published them online. since then, Maier's photographs have been exhibited in North America, Europe, Asia and 
                South America while her life and work have been the subject of books and documentary films.
