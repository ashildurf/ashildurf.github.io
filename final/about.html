            You may have searched the web, books or any other
            medium for information about the great minds that 
            paved the road to the fate of the world we live in 
            today. Most of these lists consists mostly or even comp  
            letely of males. Does that mean women didn't contri 
            bute to the innovations, art, leadership and discoveries that 
            got us to where we are today?  No. Without
            them humankind wouldn't have achieved half the things they have. 
            This website was made to honor these women and give 
            them the recognition they deserve.
