                    Eleanor Roosevelt was an American politician, diplomat and activist. 
                    She was the First Lady of the United States from March 1933 to April 1945.
                    She was controversial at the time for her outspokenness, particularly her stance on racial issues. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies.
                    She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the civil rights of African Americans and Asian Americans, and the rights of World War II refugees.

                Abigail Adams was the First lady of the United States from 1735-1826. 
                She opposed slavery and pushed for women's rights and education. Her famous line "remember the ladies" was followed by urging her husband not to put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands.
                While her husband traveled political duties, she took over and managed the family farm and business affairs.

                  Shirley Chisholm was an American politician, educator, and author.
                  In 1968, she became the first black woman elected to the United States Congress,
                  and she represented New York's 12th Congressional District for seven terms from 1969 to 1983. In 1972, she became the first black candidate for a major party's nomination for President of the United States, and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.
                  In 2015, Chisholm was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

                 Qui Jin was a Chinese revolutionary, feminist, and writer in the 19th century.
                 Qiu grew up in her ancestral home, Shanyin Village, Shaoxing, Zhejiang. During an unhappy marriage, Qiu came into contact with new ideas. She became a member of the Triads and Tongmenghui secret society
                 who at the time advocated the overthrow of the Qing and restoration of Han Chinese governance.
                 Qiu wrote a manifesto entitled "A Respectful Proclamation to China's 200 Million Women Comrades", where she lamented the problems caused by bound feet and oppressive marriages.
                 Qiu was executed after a failed uprising against the Qing dynasty, and she is considered a national heroine in China.

                Malala Yousafzai, born 1997, is a Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate.
                She is known for human rights advocacy, especially the education of women and children in her native Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northwest Pakistan, where the local Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. She was shot in the head by a Taliban and she remained unconscious and in critical condition at the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, but later her condition improved enough for her to be sent to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK. Her advocacy has grown into an international movement for women's rights and fighting terrorism.

                       Wu Zetian or 'Empress Wu', born 647, Wu was the sole officially recognized empress regnant of China in more than two millennia. 
                       The importance to history of Wu Zetian's period of political and military leadership includes the major expansion of the Chinese empire, extending it far beyond its previous territorial limits, deep into Central Asia, and engaging in a series of wars on the Korean Peninsula, first allying with Silla against Goguryeo, and then against Silla over the occupation of former Goguryeo territory. Within China, besides the more direct consequences of her struggle to gain and maintain supreme power, Wu's leadership resulted in important effects regarding social class in Chinese society and in relation to state support for Taoism, Buddhism, education, and literature.
